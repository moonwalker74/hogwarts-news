    <h4>Houses, An Obsolete System? </h4>Founded in 990 A.D., Hogwarts always had Houses representing values cherished by the four founders: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. They all wanted to bring out certain qualities in the students belonging in their respective houses. Students eat, sleep, study along their housemates. The whole House system discourage them from fraternizing between Houses, it brings up competition. What if we got rid of it all?

Twenty years since The Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter, freed the Wizarding World of the evil oppression of Death Eaters. In all that time, our world has changed, for the better.

      <h2 style="letter-spacing:-2px;">Is Getting Rid of Houses the Next Step? —</h2>
      <div class="author">by Ramona Meadows, Sixth Year Student.</div>
      <div>
    <p>Founded in 990 A.D., Hogwarts always had Houses representing values cherished by the four founders: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. They all wanted to bring out certain qualities in the students belonging in their respective houses. There are the brave, the smart, the loyal, and the cunning. But I do not want to be just smart or just brave. I, as a person, am more than that. I am brave and witty and patient and resourceful. I am all at once.</p>

<p>When the Sorting Hat was placed on my head six years ago, I was all out of sorts. I can proudly say that I am a muggle-born. I spent all that summer after receiving my letter reading up on what kind of crazy school I was going to. I knew briefly what these houses represented when I sat on that stool, awaiting the verdict. It took a second for it to tell me that I was going to love my house before shouting “RAVENCLAW!” loudly in the Great Hall. I was delighted. I was eleven years old and my favorite color was blue. I thought it was destiny. And the Sorting Hat was right. I loved it. I still do. </p>

<p>But — and yes there is a but — my whole childhood, my whole development into a young adult was spent hanging around Ravenclaws. I slept in the dormitories with them, ate at our table, went to class with them, supported them at Quidditch. Until my third year I never wanted to have anything to do with people from any other houses. I believed that Hufflepuffs were weak, that Slytherins had bad intentions, that Gryffindor were hot-blooded. I was ignorant and just wanted to win the House Cup, to belong and be proud of my people. I was focused on the competition.</p>

<p>Until that one day, the last day at Hogwarts before the Christmas holidays during my third year. Everything was going wrong that day, I didn’t have time to say properly good-bye to my friends, I lost some of my books, I got in a fight with my roommates, it was the worst things that could ever happen to thirteen year old me. Until I got to the Hogwarts Express, and the only carriage with an empty spot I could find was already filled with a Gryffindor, a Hufflepuff and a Slytherin. They all looked like they knew each other and had been friends for a while. They were two years older than me. Thirteen-year-old me could not understand how they could all stand each other; if we weren’t from the same house, then we shouldn’t have the same ambitions and hobbies.</p>

<p>I was prejudiced. Since I was a kid, I was told to stay with my House and beat the other ones. Except for a few classes where we were mixed up I was never encouraged to interact with others. This year is about celebrating the end of the He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, Voldemort. This year is about celebrating pure-bloods, half-bloods, muggle-born all living together. So I have a proposition. Let’s get rid of Houses, this archaic system segregating kids into groups based on what they will (probably) grow up to be and what they should value the most.</p>

      <h2>Twenty Years After the War:<br>How Are They <br>—</h2>
      <div class="author">by Robin McAllen and Finley Ogg, Seventh Year Students.</div>
      <div>
    <p>Twenty years have passed since the Battle of Hogwarts and the Second War ended. Twenty years since He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, Voldemort, has been defeated. Twenty years since The Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter, freed the Wizarding World of the evil oppression of Death Eaters. In all that time, our world has changed, for the better. Today we go back and remember this time so that no one forget those who gave their lives so that we could have a future. After following our Hogwarts Headmistress, Professor McGonagall for two weeks, she finally agreed to give us an interview along with Herbology Professor Neville Longbottom, Head of Auror Office Harry Potter himself, The Boy Who Lived. </p>

<p>After learning about the Second War and the Battle of Hogwarts at home and in class, we decided that the best way to celebrate and remember was to actually talked to people who fought. We asked them their strongest memory of that time.<br/>
<b>Professor McGonagall</b>: It was a very trying time. Everything was uncertain. We had to make sure that the children were safe, it was my highest priority.<br/>
<b>Professor Longbottom</b>: That year at Hogwarts when the Death Eaters at taken over was hard. But organizing a resistance, figuring out everything we needed from the Room of Requirement, it was a real test of friendship and allegiance. <br/>
<b>Harry Potter</b>: What I will always remember from that time is probably the overwhelming support I got from friends. It was very dangerous at the time to be openly supportive of me and yet, things like PotterWatch and other organized groups were still there for me.
</p>

<p>It has been almost ten years since the first students born after the War started at Hogwarts. I know that some of you were as young as we are when you were fighting. For us, young people, who do not know what it was to live in such a divided world, do you have any advice in making the world better and make sure that something like that doesn’t ever happen again?<br/>
<b>Professor McGonagall</b>: Tolerance and respect are qualities that no one should ever forget about. Living life without prejudicing against others is important, we should not make any difference in how we treat people no matter what house they belong to, or their family, anything.<br/>
<b>Professor Longbottom</b>: Any advice? Well, always study, be interested in what is happening and most importantly always make an opinion for yourself. Be kind.<br/>
<b>Harry Potter</b>: Always try to make the world a better place. There is still a lot to do, we shouldn’t think that, since Voldemort has been defeated, everything is fine and back to normal. We should always strive to make our world a better place. A lot could have been avoided if only we had been more respectful between ourselves but also with other species.

          <h2>Muggles<br>—Should We Care?</h2>
      <div class="author">By Ida Bracken, Third Year Student.</div>
        <div>
	      <p>With the push for the new Mandatory Muggle Studies Act, we should ask ourselves important questions about our relationship to Muggles and their inventions. While some push to challenge the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, others just want to eradicate anything referring to Muggles in our world. I am not so radical as saying that magic should be shared with muggles immediately. I believe that it would be dangerous and would probably start another war. What I am suggesting is studying Muggles more thoroughly.</p>
	      <p>Some people are being chastised, or even mocked sometimes for their desire to no more about Muggle Technologies and Inventions. But what if we celebrated this interest? What if we created a whole division just to implement new Muggle Technologies into our Wizarding World. You probably heard of the outrage that a couple of Muggle-born students started a few years ago by refusing to use quill and instead bringing “muggle writing tools” as it was described back then. Nowadays using a pen rather than a quill is just a personal style. Nobody looks at anyone differently for choosing so. Wizard started manufacturing them themselves so that they could bewitch the ink as the fancy takes them!</p>
	      <p>My belief is not that we should reveal ourselves and share magic with every Muggle we see. My belief is that we should enrich ourselves by using what they built; they managed to survive this long without any magic, there must be a reason. If we could just study what they created and personalize it for us, wizards and witches, I truly believes that we could make our world better. It maybe a strange thing to believe, something that people might make you feel ashamed for believing in. But more and more people are starting to realize that staying shut in our own ways could be our demise.</p>

          <h2>More Rights For The Non-Wizards<br>—</h2>
      <div class="author">By Cedric Midgen, Seventh Year Student.</div>
      <div>
	      <p>It has been 15 years since the Remus Lupin Act passed and the controversial but much-needed change to the Ministry Classification of Magical Creatures has been put in place, where do we stand on our treatment of Magical Creatures. Goblins, Vampires, Werewolves, House-elves,  Centaurs, all demand specific rights but can hundreds of years of exploitation and ill-treatment be cancelled by a few reforms?</p>
	      <p>The Ministry of Magic stopped treating werewolves as Beast and now treats them as Being, making the Wolfsbane Potion as accessible as possible for those who want it. But, still, to this day, there is still a lot of discrimination regarding werewolves in the work environment. Many are still hiding their conditions because of the stigma the condition still get.</p>
	      <p>We like to think that, if treated well, House-Elves are happy to serve. Yet, we are still enslaving them and using he old magic forcing them to follow orders from their masters. Dobby was the first elf to ever ask for payment in exchange for his work. Professor Dumbledore agreed, and yet he was the only one getting paid. They are still dressed in rags and forbidden to own a wand according to the Code of Wand Use passed by the Wizard’s Council in 1631.</p>
	      <p>The same goes for Goblins. After multiple wars and revolutions, they are still considered inferiors being by most of the wizarding community. Ever since the Second Wizarding War, the Brotherhood of Goblins has been pretty vocal about getting the right to carry and use a wand. They also argue that if they had been valued earlier they might have sided against Voldemort during the war instead of not getting involved. Their main demand today, aside from the right to carry a wand, is the recognition of Goblins’ idea of ownership regarding Goblin made artefact. </p>
	      <p>I believed it is fair to ask ourselves the following question: If we grant every single demands of every single Non-Wizard species, would the way we treat each other change? Or would the prejudice that wizards hold against them and the entitlement we have, thinking we are more evolved, always be an obstacle to our relationships? I believe it is time for the Wizarding work to re-think itself and strive for more equality between species.</p>
