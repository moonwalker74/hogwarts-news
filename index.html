    <h4>Houses, An Obsolete System? </h4>Founded in 990 A.D., Hogwarts always had Houses representing values cherished by the four founders: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. They all wanted to bring out certain qualities in the students belonging in their respective houses. Students eat, sleep, study along their housemates. The whole House system discourage them from fraternizing between Houses, it brings up competition. What if we got rid of it all?

      <p>Twenty years have passed since the Battle of Hogwarts and the Second War ended. Twenty years since He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, Voldemort, has been defeated. Twenty years since The Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter, freed the Wizarding World of the evil oppression of Death Eaters. In all that time, our world has changed, for the better. Today we go back and remember this time so that no one forget those who gave their lives so that we could have a future.</p>

<p>Through exclusive interviews from people like Professor Longbottom, Headmistress McGonagal, Harry Potter himself and more we reflect on this difficult time and learn how life has changed in the past twenty years and how it feels to live in a world where Voldemort is not a threat anymore. </p>

      <h2 style="letter-spacing:-2px;">Is Getting Rid of Houses the Next Step? —</h2>
      <div class="author">by Ramona Meadows, Sixth Year Student.</div>
      <div>
    <p>Founded in 990 A.D., Hogwarts always had Houses representing values cherished by the four founders: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. They all wanted to bring out certain qualities in the students belonging in their respective houses. There are the brave, the smart, the loyal, and the cunning. But I do not want to be just smart or just brave. I, as a person, am more than that. I am brave and witty and patient and resourceful. I am all at once.</p>

<p>When the Sorting Hat was placed on my head six years ago, I was all out of sorts. I can proudly say that I am a muggle-born. I spent all that summer after receiving my letter reading up on what kind of crazy school I was going to. I knew briefly what these houses represented when I sat on that stool, awaiting the verdict. It took a second for it to tell me that I was going to love my house before shouting “RAVENCLAW!” loudly in the Great Hall. I was delighted. I was eleven years old and my favorite color was blue. I thought it was destiny. And the Sorting Hat was right. I loved it. I still do. </p>

<p>But — and yes there is a but — my whole childhood, my whole development into a young adult was spent hanging around Ravenclaws. I slept in the dormitories with them, ate at our table, went to class with them, supported them at Quidditch. Until my third year I never wanted to have anything to do with people from any other houses. I believed that Hufflepuffs were weak, that Slytherins had bad intentions, that Gryffindor were hot-blooded. I was ignorant and just wanted to win the House Cup, to belong and be proud of my people. I was focused on the competition.</p>

<p>Until that one day, the last day at Hogwarts before the Christmas holidays during my third year. Everything was going wrong that day, I didn’t have time to say properly good-bye to my friends, I lost some of my books, I got in a fight with my roommates, it was the worst things that could ever happen to thirteen year old me. Until I got to the Hogwarts Express, and the only carriage with an empty spot I could find was already filled with a Gryffindor, a Hufflepuff and a Slytherin. They all looked like they knew each other and had been friends for a while. They were two years older than me. Thirteen-year-old me could not understand how they could all stand each other; if we weren’t from the same house, then we shouldn’t have the same ambitions and hobbies.</p>

<p>I was prejudiced. Since I was a kid, I was told to stay with my House and beat the other ones. Except for a few classes where we were mixed up I was never encouraged to interact with others. This year is about celebrating the end of the He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, Voldemort. This year is about celebrating pure-bloods, half-bloods, muggle-born all living together. So I have a proposition. Let’s get rid of Houses, this archaic system segregating kids into groups based on what they will (probably) grow up to be and what they should value the most.</p>

      <h2>Twenty Years After the War:<br>How Are They <br>—</h2>
      <div class="author">by Robin McAllen and Finley Ogg, Seventh Year Students.</div>
      <div>
    <p>Twenty years have passed since the Battle of Hogwarts and the Second War ended. Twenty years since He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, Voldemort, has been defeated. Twenty years since The Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter, freed the Wizarding World of the evil oppression of Death Eaters. In all that time, our world has changed, for the better. Today we go back and remember this time so that no one forget those who gave their lives so that we could have a future. After following our Hogwarts Headmistress, Professor McGonagall for two weeks, she finally agreed to give us an interview along with Herbology Professor Neville Longbottom, Head of Auror Office Harry Potter himself, The Boy Who Lived. </p>

<p>After learning about the Second War and the Battle of Hogwarts at home and in class, we decided that the best way to celebrate and remember was to actually talked to people who fought. We asked them their strongest memory of that time.<br/>
<b>Professor McGonagall</b>: It was a very trying time. Everything was uncertain. We had to make sure that the children were safe, it was my highest priority.<br/>
<b>Professor Longbottom</b>: That year at Hogwarts when the Death Eaters at taken over was hard. But organizing a resistance, figuring out everything we needed from the Room of Requirement, it was a real test of friendship and allegiance. <br/>
<b>Harry Potter</b>: What I will always remember from that time is probably the overwhelming support I got from friends. It was very dangerous at the time to be openly supportive of me and yet, things like PotterWatch and other organized groups were still there for me.
</p>

<p>It has been almost ten years since the first students born after the War started at Hogwarts. I know that some of you were as young as we are when you were fighting. For us, young people, who do not know what it was to live in such a divided world, do you have any advice in making the world better and make sure that something like that doesn’t ever happen again?<br/>
<b>Professor McGonagall</b>: Tolerance and respect are qualities that no one should ever forget about. Living life without prejudicing against others is important, we should not make any difference in how we treat people no matter what house they belong to, or their family, anything.<br/>
<b>Professor Longbottom</b>: Any advice? Well, always study, be interested in what is happening and most importantly always make an opinion for yourself. Be kind.<br/>
<b>Harry Potter</b>: Always try to make the world a better place. There is still a lot to do, we shouldn’t think that, since Voldemort has been defeated, everything is fine and back to normal. We should always strive to make our world a better place. A lot could have been avoided if only we had been more respectful between ourselves but also with other species.
